Alfa Cortex is an improved and modified version of the Alfa Shell backdoor, specifically designed to evade and bypass WAF with better version, enhanced stealth and efficiency.<br>Engineered for power and versatility, it integrates advanced techniques to remain undetected while maintaining full control over the target environment, Alfa Cortex is built to push the limits of webshell penetration, offering a high-performance, adaptable, and undetectable experience.<br><br>
Key Features:

* WAF Bypass: Optimized to evade security filters and firewalls.
* Enhanced Stealth: Improved obfuscation and anti-detection mechanisms.
* Powerful Execution: Supports a wide range of commands and exploits.
* Feature-Rich Interface: Provides extensive functionality while maintaining simplicity.
<br><br>
There will be 2 versions of Alfa Cortex:

* Alfa Cortex bypass with minimal features
* Alfa Cortex bypass without features
<br>
Minimal features means that only a few features are present or features that are definitely be used, other useless features are removed to reduce the size of the file.<br>
Without features means there are no features at all other than Settings and Logout.<br>
both have the same bypass function, that makes the difference only in the features.

```
you can't change Alfa Cortex settings through the webshell
this caused by the bypass function.
to change Alfa Cortex settings you must change it through the source code
go open the Alfa Cortex source code and find this string "// settings"
you can change the settings from there.
